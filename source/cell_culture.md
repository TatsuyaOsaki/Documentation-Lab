## HEK293T cells for AAV packaging 

1. Coat new flask(s) with gelatin, and let sit for one hour in hood
-  T75: 5mL
- 6 well plate: 1mL per well
2. Warm DMEM (+FBS) media, PBS and Trypsin in 37Â°C bead bath
3. Wash HEK cells
- 3.1. Aspirate media
- 3.2 2Perform 1 wash with 10mL of PBS

4. After aspirating PBS, add 3mL of trypsin
5. Incubate and monitor for 3-15min
- With HEK cells at 90-100% confluency, 5 min has worked well
6. Collect the 3mL trypsin + cells with a 5mL serological pipette, and place in a 15mL falcon tube
7. Immediately add 7mL of culture media to the falcon tube
8. 
| :exclamation:  This is very important   |
|-----------------------------------------|
Gently homogenize using the pipette to evenly distribute cells

9.  Aspirate gelatin from new culture dish and replace with media
    a.     T75: 9-10mL
    b.    6 well plate: 2mL/well
9.  Add the appropriate volume of cells in suspension from falcon tube to each T75 flask or plate depending on your desired dilution
