### Protocols

1. Coat new flask(s) with gelatin, and let sit for one hour in hood
-  T75: 5mL
- 6 well plate: 1mL per well
2. Warm DMEM (+FBS) media, PBS and Trypsin in 37Â°C bead bath
3. Wash HEK cells
- 3.1. Aspirate media
- 3.2. 2Perform 1 wash with 10mL of PBS

4. After aspirating PBS, add 3mL of trypsin
5. Incubate and monitor for 3-15min
- With HEK cells at 90-100% confluency, 5 min has worked well
6. Collect the 3mL trypsin + cells with a 5mL serological pipette, and place in a 15mL falcon tube
7. Immediately add 7mL of culture media to the 15ml of falcon tube
   
8. Gently homogenize using the pipette to evenly distribute cells

9. Aspirate gelatin from new culture dish and replace with media
    ```
    T75: 9-10mL
    6 well plate: 2mL/well
    ```
10. Add the appropriate volume of cells in suspension from falcon tube to each T75 flask or plate depending on your desired dilution
