## Protocols
``Thawing cells from freezing cells``

1. Thaw AAV293 cells in 37°C waterbath.
2. Add to 5 mL of 293T culture medium.
3. Spin down 5 min at 1000 rpm
4. Resuspend in 10 mL 293T culture medium.
5. Plate in 75 cm 2 flask. No need for coating.
```{important}
Change medium every day or every two days. If you don’t and the medium gets yellow, the cells will detach and die.
```
6. Once the cells are 90% confluent, split them 1 to 4 using trypsin:
7. rince with PBS-
8. 5 minutes in trypsin (7 to 8 mL per flask)
9. Resuspend in 7 mL medium per flask.
10. NB: For cells to be transfected: dissociate: add 7 mL medium to the flask and pipet up and down
projecting the cells on the wall of the flask for 15 times.

11. Spin down 5 min at 1000 rpm
12. Resuspend in 8 mL medium
13. Plate 2 mL cells + 8 mL medium per flask to split ¼.
