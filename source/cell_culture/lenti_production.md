## Protocols
``Thawing cells from freezing cells``

Plate 4 75 cm3 flasks of 293T cells.
Day 1: Once they are confluent, prepare 6 10 cm 3 plates, 5.10 6 to 5.10 7 cells per plate.
Day 2 (or later): once the cells are 80% confluent, transfection:
1) Add 240 uL Extreme 9 to 3 mL of DME (serum free). Incubate at RT for 5 min.
2) Add the following amount of DNA to 600 uL of DME (serum free) and mix:
30 ug gene of interest
30 ug VgV
30 ug CMV delta7871
Add the mix from step 2 to the Extreme gene 9/DME mix from Step 1. Mix well and incubate at
RT for 15 min.
Refresh the medium of the 293T culture.
Add Fugen DNA mix drop by drop to the culture (0.5 mL per plate).
Day 3: nothing
Day 4: Harvest the medium. Filter with 0.45 um filter. Centrifugate at 23000 rpm for 1:45.
Resuspend in 1 mL of PBS- or HBSS per centrifuge tube. Freeze 200 uL aliquots.
